You will now publish your bracnh from local repo to remote repo:
so u need to first create bacnh in local machine trhhough command:
git checkout -b Student1

then
git remote -v // just to make sure how many remote rops u have and connected to

if
this is written:

FromLocalRepoCreated    https://github.com/mudabbirali92/AgianPracticeFromLocal.git (fetch)
FromLocalRepoCreated    https://github.com/mudabbirali92/AgianPracticeFromLocal.git (push)

then
Your are connected!

Now
just push as you do usually but with minor changes with the brach name as you have declared at ur local repo
so follow command:
git push <RepoName> <Branch> i.e.
git push FromLocalRepoCreated Student1
